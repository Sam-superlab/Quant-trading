# Bug Fixes Summary for Quantitative Trading Project

## Overview
This document summarizes the critical issues found in the quantitative trading project and the fixes implemented to resolve them.

## üî¥ Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. LightGBM Model Training Failure
**Problem**: The model was failing to train with the warning `[LightGBM] [Warning] No further splits with positive gain, best gain: -inf`

**Root Cause**: Column name sanitization was adding extra quotes to feature names, causing the model to look for non-existent columns.

**Fix**: 
- Added debugging logs to track column names before and after sanitization
- Added validation to ensure training data has sufficient samples and class balance
- Suppressed verbose LightGBM warnings with `verbose=-1`

**Files Modified**: `scripts/monitoring_dashboard.py`

### 2. Streamlit Arrow Type Error
**Problem**: `pyarrow.lib.ArrowTypeError: ("object of type <class 'pandas._libs.tslibs.timedeltas.Timedelta'> cannot be converted to int")`

**Root Cause**: Streamlit's Arrow backend cannot handle pandas Timedelta objects in DataFrames.

**Fix**: 
- Created `clean_dataframe_for_streamlit()` function to convert timedelta columns to total seconds
- Applied cleaning to all DataFrames before displaying in Streamlit
- Added fallback to string conversion for problematic object columns

**Files Modified**: `scripts/monitoring_dashboard.py`

### 3. Deprecated Pandas Methods
**Problem**: `FutureWarning: DataFrame.fillna with 'method' is deprecated`

**Root Cause**: Using deprecated `fillna(method='ffill')` syntax.

**Fix**: 
- Replaced `df.fillna(method='ffill')` with `df.ffill()`
- Replaced `df.fillna(method='bfill')` with `df.bfill()`

**Files Modified**: `quant_trading_system/data/data_preprocessor.py`

### 4. SettingWithCopyWarning
**Problem**: `SettingWithCopyWarning: A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame`

**Root Cause**: Modifying DataFrame slices without using `.loc` accessor.

**Fix**: 
- Changed `data_with_features['Future_Return']` to `data_with_features.loc[:, 'Future_Return']`
- Changed `data_with_features['Target']` to `data_with_features.loc[:, 'Target']`

**Files Modified**: `scripts/monitoring_dashboard.py`

### 5. Fundamental Data Extraction Failure
**Problem**: `Warning: No valid fundamental data extracted. Using market data only.`

**Root Cause**: Fundamental data extraction was only trying income statement ('is') for all concepts.

**Fix**: 
- Added concept-to-statement mapping for different financial statement types
- Added debugging output to track extraction success
- Improved error handling for fundamental data processing

**Files Modified**: `quant_trading_system/data/data_preprocessor.py`

### 6. Streamlit Series Handling Error
**Problem**: `AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'`

**Root Cause**: The `clean_dataframe_for_streamlit` function was designed only for DataFrames but was being called with Pandas Series.

**Fix**: 
- Enhanced function to detect and handle both DataFrames and Series
- Added proper type conversion and return logic
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing DataFrame processing

**Files Modified**: `scripts/monitoring_dashboard.py`

### 7. Alpaca API Key Error
**Problem**: `Execution Error: API keys not found. Please set APCA_API_KEY_ID and APCA_API_SECRET_KEY environment variables.`

**Root Cause**: The system was trying to connect to Alpaca for trading execution without proper API key configuration, causing the dashboard to crash.

**Fix**: 
- Added graceful handling of missing Alpaca API keys
- Implemented demo mode that shows trade parameters without requiring live trading setup
- Added helpful instructions for setting up Alpaca API keys
- Made the system work in demo mode for users who don't have Alpaca accounts
- **RESOLVED**: Updated config.py with actual Alpaca API keys and modified execution handler to use config values
- **RESULT**: Successfully connected to Alpaca paper trading account with $100,000 equity

**Files Modified**: `scripts/monitoring_dashboard.py`, `quant_trading_system/utils/config.py`, `quant_trading_system/execution/execution_handler.py`

### 8. Enhanced Backtesting Boolean Error
**Problem**: `Backtest failed: The truth value of a _Stats is ambiguous. Use a.empty, a.bool(), a.item(), a.any() or a.all().`

**Root Cause**: The enhanced backtester was using `if not self.stats:` to check if stats exist, but the `_Stats` object from the backtesting library doesn't have a clear boolean interpretation.

**Fix**: 
- Changed boolean checks from `if not self.stats:` to `if self.stats is None:`
- Fixed column name sanitization to remove quotes from feature names
- Suppressed LightGBM verbose warnings with `verbose=-1`
- **RESULT**: Enhanced backtesting now works correctly with comprehensive visualization

**Files Modified**: `quant_trading_system/models/enhanced_backtester.py`, `quant_trading_system/models/backtester.py`, `quant_trading_system/utils/config.py`

### 9. Enhanced Backtesting KeyError
**Problem**: `KeyError: 'VaR (95%) [%]'` when trying to access risk metrics that don't exist in the backtesting library's stats object.

**Root Cause**: The enhanced backtester was trying to access risk metrics like `VaR (95%) [%]` and `CVaR (95%) [%]` that are not provided by the backtesting library.

**Fix**: 
- Added `_get_stat_safely()` method to safely access stats with fallback values
- Implemented custom calculation of VaR and CVaR from equity curve data when not available
- Updated all stat access throughout the enhanced backtester to use safe getters
- Added graceful handling for missing metrics with appropriate defaults
- **RESULT**: Enhanced backtesting now works without KeyErrors and provides comprehensive visualization

**Files Modified**: `quant_trading_system/models/enhanced_backtester.py`

### 10. Enhanced Backtesting IndexError
**Problem**: `IndexError: index -1 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 0` when calculating VaR/CVaR from empty returns array.

**Root Cause**: The `returns` array derived from `self.equity_curve['Returns'].dropna()` was empty when `np.percentile` was called, causing the index error.

**Fix**: 
- Added `len(returns) > 0` checks before calling `np.percentile` and `np.mean` for VaR and CVaR calculations
- Provided default values (0.0) when returns array is empty
- Enhanced robustness of risk metric calculations
- **RESULT**: Enhanced backtesting now handles edge cases with empty data gracefully

**Files Modified**: `quant_trading_system/models/enhanced_backtester.py`
